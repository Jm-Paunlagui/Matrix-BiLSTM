0,"hindi malinaw magbigay ng instructions, nangkukumpara sa ibang section"
0,"in giving instructions it is not clear that she is different and the students are still wrong even though she is the one who did not clear the given task, lack of organization and fairness"
0,"she needs to be a role model to her students, because we as a student we experienced from her to received unappropriated words which is below the belt for us. as a prof. or as a teacher, they are the one to shape the student's behavior not to discourage them. but to encourage and motivate her students to keep study hard and fulfill their dreams in the future."
0,i think she needs to improve on how to approach her students.
0,"she must know how to be consistent of what she says because sometimes it changes and when it happened, we, the students are to blame not her because shes a teacher. she also dont know how to respect others opinions. though she speaks with po and opo but her tone doesn’t mean she respected who speaks. she is not considerate, using lms is not easy, we face a lot of difficulties and system errors but she dont consider those to give chance for us. bagsak kami lahat sa kaniya bcoz of her attitude. lagi syang galit nakakatakot!"
0,"i think kailangan nya po i-improve yung pagbibigay nya ng instructions, dapat po consistent instructions nya. every time po kasi na nagbibigay sya ng instructions tapos kinabukasan po sasabihin nya samin na hindi ganoon yung instructions na binigay nya kaya in the end po is mababa po binibigay nyang scores then minsan pinapaulit nya po. medyo mahirap naman po na mag reklamo po mismo sakanya kase po nami-misunderstand nya po yung mga sinasabi namin."
0,"namamahiya , hindi tumatanngap ng ibang sagot lalo na sa mga quiz enumeration pa naman yung gusto nya lang na sagot ang tama . magulo magbigay ng instruction. sa mga quiz at exam hindi nag bibibgay ng instruction sa lms. hindi manlang ma-approach regarding sa subject nya. palaging galit pag may tinatanong sa kanya. walang consideration parang sya lng yung subject na tini-take namin sobrang dami magpagawa ng activity, kahit health break pinaggagawa kami. lahat nalang mali sa kanya parang wala kaming ginawang tama, nawawalan na tuloy ako ng gana pumasok dahil sa kanya sobrang nakakababa ng confidence."
0,pagbibigay ng panuto.
0,"she definitely need to improve and change her pride, personality, professionalism, and way of communicating with students. if she doesn't feel excited and like the output, she will criticize and ashamed the student in front of the class. and she definitely need to stop like acting a major subject to english majors, because while the rest of our major subject only required lesson plans and other activities. she required us to make an abstract thesis this semester! which we did, but she criticize it and tell start over again. because she doesn't get excited about it."
1,i think there is no need to improve because she deliberates the step by step process of making the capstone by knowing what is the proper way of writing the capstone paper.
1,"i don't think i could think of something, but i guess keep improving what she does best."
1,it's all good

0,"the instructor lacks consideration in terms of taking quiz and examinations (internet connection problem is not being considered, all he considered is life/death situations).

the instructor doesn’t explain clearly to the students on how answers are done, he’s willing to explain it but just on his own way whereby us students are still unable to understand. 

the instructor is always with a statement of “alam nyo na yan hindi ko na i-eexplain” whereby us students are not that really knowledgeable enough. 

the instructor’s way of teaching is just reading the whole module, while the quiz/assessments are more on problems which he’s not able to teach us. the instructor’s modules are full of theories while on the other hand our quizzes/assessments are full of computational problems which are not even discussed to us."
0,the instructor must practice how to answer question properly and not in a sarcastic way. provide longer time for quizzes and assessment since this is an accounting subject. during face to face we take quizzes for the whole class time. not for 30 minutes only especially for those long problems given.
0,"improve attitude. sometimes acts unprofessionally, responding to students in a not good manner.

improve learning style. hindi lahat naituturo, ibang iba ang level of difficulty ng nasa lesson provided sa quiz and exam na pinatatake.

be considerate. please always consider the suggestion of students. like one time, may nagtanong if pwede gawing skippable yung exam pero he refuses. and don sa time allotted per quiz sana suitable to the types of questions. hind yung kung kelan computational saka mas maikli yung time."
1,"for me, it is much better, even if we already tackle the lessons back in lower years, it will be a great help for us if he can at least teach it again. especially, computations."
0,medyo unprofessional lang po kase kada magtuturo sya laging maingay ang background and di pa po sya nag oopen ng cam. quizzes and exams nya ay laging time pressure. nasanay ako mula 1st year na binibigyan kami ng enough time to compute the problems ang nangyayari tuloy sa takot ko maubusan ng time hinuhulaan na lang ang ibang items makaabot lang sa time limit.

0,"the thing that this instructor needs to improve is the patience. based on our observation, she always gets mad every time one of us didn't answer immediately."
0,"she is not that very considerate of her students. i think she doesn't know the difficulty of finding a good spot and network just to attend an online class. she always assume we just want to slack off whenever we failed to attend her class. she's angry at us most of the time, specially when we cannot answer her questions. i understand that she's already quite old but she should know that students learned best when their instructor is kind to them. honestly, i can't remember anything she had taught us, just the feeling of her wrath."
0,"we want in-depth discussions, not reading what is in the module. we want pure professionalism not discouragement from the instructor. well, a few sermons are fine because she is both a teacher and a mother. if the students want to pass the subject we need to study all by ourselves, pay subscriptions to get an online tutor, and find educational videos to ease the difficulty of understanding the lesson."

0,"she needed to know that not every students have the good internet connection. some do not have a good cellphone to use during online class. she should not tell students to ""palakasin mo ang signal. bawal ang mahina ang signal."" because the students won't do anything about it. another, she should not do things to lower the confidence of her students like "" ayusin mo, para kang patay bumasa at iba pa na nagpapahiya sya ng estudyante sa madaming paraan kagaya ng pag galit sya. "" she should not always angry to her class because it will be make her class not interested in proceeding the discussion. she is always have the recitation and i don't know why she always do that in the class, when she do that there is always"" pagpapahiya at pa galit sa to o nya, minsan di sya maintindihan"". i know she is already in her old age but still, she must learn to give consideration to her students as well."
0,"we know that ma'am was in her age pero she doesn't have consideration po kahit konti. so it's hard for us na intindihin sya kase may age na rin naman po. isa lang to sa incident, one time medyo nalate kaklase namin sa attendance, she said sorry dahil bumagal lang yung wifi but ma'am aswered her na ""palakasin mo"" we hope na magkaron po sya ng consideration kahit konti knowing that it's online class po."

0,"consideration and empathy, hope so."
0,"empathy, understanding of the student's circumstances due to poor internet connection. i find it difficult at times because the instructor gives us overwhelming pressure whenever we have a group discussion. a little consideration is important for us, we cannot say it upfront because we're afraid to be misunderstood and judged."

she always repeat her lesson even it is already finish to discuss.

0,nothing improvement because in the first we meet her in our sychronous class her attitude was very bad she always pressure his/her student and she ignore the efforts and work of his/her student.and she gives feedback or comment that hurts the students and most of all she does not think about the words he utter.
0,"sana po medyo bagalan niya po magsalita at palawakin pa po ang mga halimbawa sa tinatalakay.sana po maging mahinahon po siya,ipaliwanag po ng maayos at huwag magpahiya ng studyante dahil lahat naman po ay nagkakamali."
0,"one of the areas that she needs to improve is the clarity of the instruction and stable decision about her instruction. sometimes she didn't follow what she stated on the other day. but the rest, our experience in this instructor is good. her course taught us that ""kapag bagsak ka sa quiz/exam move on na agad"" hahahahahaha"

0,"we have meeting once a week, but still, not always present or in time. it appears that other questions in the exam are not in the module. last exam, we waited for almost 2 hours because he released it late, without even an announcement."
0,"i think it will be very great if he will conduct a class more often. i really looked forward to learning a lot from this subject since it is indeed interesting but reading the lessons on our own more frequent than his presence is not helpful for us. we really struggle a lot during exams, we can learn through internet of course but i think, it's just different when a professor is explaining the topic to us. 
 i hope this will not make you feel that bad, i still i appreacite you sir :)"

0,"sometimes, speaks so fast."

0,"nakakalungkot po na wala po kaming natutunan sa subject ni sir and ang unfair po nung part na kami po yung magseset ng oras kung kelan po namin gustong magklase sa kanya given the fact na may schedule naman po lahat ng subjects para sa synchronous and asynchronous class. magaling naman po si sir sobra, siguro lang po inassume ni sir na ok lang samin na di sya nagtuturo."
0,implement consistent synchronous classes.
0,"wala kami naging klase sa kanya. as in walang online class at late ang exam. susulpot lang pag exam so ano po kaya matututuhan namin sa kanya. online pa naman po, mahirap mag aral online po. yun lang okay po sana siya magturo noon. :)"

0,"he should learn to trust his students. also, learn to minimize background noise during the class."
0,"in terms of giving enough and considerable time to finish quizzes for the us, students, not to feel nervous and pressured during quizzes and exams."
0,don't be so strict because sometimes concerns of the students are being disregarded.
0,"on the other hand, limiting so much the time on quizzes cant provide us ample time to answer it correctly or even ""practice"" to solve it. the pressure adds up to the time. the question sometimes doesn't stick to our mind for the goal only is to making scores. i hope you could give some sample activities that doesn't have to apply scores, maybe a plus only to the highest student or something. students need to practice themselves and giving them the resources and the ability to explain them the activities will be good. i don't know with others sir, but expect us that before we go to class we already read something and we may also bring some questions in mind. we could practice and ask questions while on class, so that the pressure goes not on the quiz and score but upon practicing what we read. this is applied by our professor before, and we loved how she taught us how to not value scores but learning."

0,"this final term hindi na namin siya nakita, hindi nadin nagdiscuss. siguro sobrang busy lang niya."

0,pagtuturo po sa scheduled date
0,"personally, i like how they assigned us insightful assessment activities, but i think we still should've gotten tests like the usual ones to help us remember the specifics of the discussed concepts better."
0,"he should follow and respect their given schedules accordingly. (note: he schedules online meetings for all his handled students during saturday at 8pm. the meeting was not mandatory but then, he said that the advantage of attending will count as added recitation. this makes the students feel like they are forced to attend the weekend meeting for the sake of getting the incentives even it was not mandatory.) he did fb live but that does not assure us that the students really watch the live nor the recorded fb live.

he should also use the lms when handing out activities instead of the gclassroom.

1,"i can't think of anything because for me, he is an excellent instructor."
0,pagbibigay ng madaling activities.
0,"as i am a working student, i wish they'd show more consideration to us by providing recorded lectures of the discussions. having to learn the subject only through the module the instructor provides is a bit grueling."
0,output-based assessments and activities are good but the time-frame must be enough to do the tasks.
0,focus on teaching the students. do not play with your phone or other personal activities while having discussion. there are always so many dead air.
0,"the instructor needs to build a good way of teaching for students to learn and not be pressured in the course subject. since it was online, he needs to understand that students are not well equip so there was a possiblity of interuption when it comes to recitation. also, i suggested that he can provide an effective power point for the students to catch up the lessons."
0,"in terms of recitation, some of the terms is for him to explain for us to learn more."
0,"... it feels like he is not in the mood when discussing. he gives us this slouching posture which makes the student feel lazy whenever we had meetings with him. 
he only became productive when someone was observing the class, then right after the observer left, he, again, showed us the slouching posture and even texting while on the meeting."
0,"but in terms of his synchronous classes with him, his type of discussion is not for everyone. his supposedly playful approach of student-teacher engagement may come out as unprofessionalism from our perspectives (may pa sound effects pa which is very annoying). discussions niya is puro ""recitation"". it doesn't matter if maubos yung oras kasi walang nasagot, hindi niya ieexplain yung thought nung isang concept most of the time. siya lang nagexplain halos lahat nung lesson nung may nagobserve sa kanya nung last lecture namin. yung mga pa activity niya po is very far from the actual lessons, parang yung ituturo niya sa amin is isang beses lang maeencounter kasi yung magiging activity niya in that particular lesson is walang kinalaman doon."
0,"the instructor can improve the way she can speak and deliver her words because i can't understand her instruction. i know that pe class needs a instructor that has an ability to instruct well to be clarify to the students. she always instruct in a wrong way because inaasa na lang niya sa iba yung gagawin ng students. it is hard to understand her point even if you listen on it. also, as a professional and college teacher i sugeest that she can act this way."
0,visual presentation
0,"she is easily disturbed by her co teachers, doing the marites thing, and does not focuses on her students. the way she makes a ppt is very unprofessional which needs a lot of improvement as well as how to use the lms since from what i have observed, she is still exploring how to use it. we used google drive the entire semester to pass our activities and only uses the lms just to get the link of the gdrive and the arnis video, which, i think, is pretty useless because what we need is the whole lecture in spite of her unprofessional ppt. she also say this, ""basahin niyo nalan, kayo na bahala umintindi""

note: we were only able to discuss a lesson which is arnis and its strike, is it really just that?"
0,"i noticed that she is not very knowledgeable on technology devices. she doesn't know how the lms works. then i don't know if typographical error lang or kung nagkamali talaga siya spelling ""modern"" as ""mothern"". her ppt presentations looks like it's rushed and done last minute. but i understand, kasi she told us many times that her laptop is not very good as it lags everytime."

0,"in terms of her being more techy, i think she should improve in that phase more since it's the new normal"
1,none so far.
1,i couldn't think of any.
0,not considering the current situation which is we are not observing school setting like before the pandemic so it is hard for us to answer all the fs episodes.
1,i have nothing more to say because of his superb ability in teaching this course.
1,"there is no need to improve as she carries the course and knows it very well. in addition, she is one of the professors that is very considerate and very understanding."
1,none i think because she is a very great instructor.
0,"communication with the students, maybe? although they're very nice during discussions, i'm a little intimidated to talk/reach out to them for clarifications due to previous encounters..."

0,consideration
0,i hope she can improve her communication skills to the students. there are times that the discussion don't seem interesting because she didn't encourage interaction in class.
0,"please let the students give them second chance to answer the quizzes that you gave and excuse working students who work for themselves to support their study because it is also hard for us to have in this situation, and also believe us when we explained ourselves for not able to take the quizzes, and make the deadline of every quizzes and exam untill 11:59 on the mark date for the students who is at work so that they can able to take after work. please considerate working students."
0,i think she should start practice to speak slowly because she is a little bit fast sometimes. but it's all understandable at all
0,slowly speak
0,"the recorded videos should be downloadable. in that way, students saves more data usage that can be use to their online classes."
0,i don't see any areas where it needs improving.
0,"n/a. just the schedule of the course which is 4pm to 7pm. students are pretty tired at this rate. if possible, can we at least move it in the morning and split the 3-hour discussion into (2) an hour and a half discussion?"
0,i think she can improve her communication to the students so the class can be interactive and not be silent always. she can also engage a question first even if she were doing a lecture so that we can catch up the course subject. i suggest that she can do other way of teaching so that the course subject make easy since it is major.
0,"in case of giving assessment and quizzes, the time for problem solving type of questions should be balanced to the number of items so that we can manage the time also. and sometimes she appears too intimidating causing the students to not raise questions in class."
0,explain some terms for us to follow in the discussion
0,her areas of improvement are according to her strengths. i personally think she is too kind and too considerate. but i don't think she should change it. professors like her are what we need in times like this.

0,i can't think anything that the instructor to improve because the way of she teach is effective for the students.
1,"all the strengths is in her, she is really a great prof!"
0,"even though there is always a recording ready, i feel like she didn't meet us personally enough. other than that, i don't have anything more suggestions for her to improve."
1,none because she is a great instructor.
0,"... there was one time, she still want to discuss during academic break, and her message was structured to guilt trip her student. (this happened to another section) 
along with this, she should follow and respect their given schedules accordingly as she schedules exams/quizzes every saturday at 8pm and she once accidentally forgot to post the quiz but still insisted to post it late at night... (around 9pm). she also need to improve the use of lms, she limit the time to access the quiz for 3 hours where in fact she can limit it the whole day without the student cheating or feel unfair.

30 mins, kwento, then the rest, lecture.
"
0,give activity / quizzes in weekdays
0,they should practice more compassion to the students. provided m
0,extension on time for the quizzes
0,"i think po, maam needs to put a little more consideration when it terms sa time po sa pagt take and pagbibigay niya ng quizes, yes po considerate siya pero maling tao po ata ang napapakinggan niya so maling way po ng pagiging considerate yung nagagawa niya, yung mas important or mas need po na request ang hindi na niya naco consider eh."
0,she should be more attentive with the time since there are other professors next to her....
0,"i think she can improve the way she communicate students. having a personal experience is good but if it is always being telled in class there was possibility of the students not being engage or listen. in short, she needs to maximize her time so that student learn more and not always over time. i know that time is important and not being wasted."
0,be more timely since there is one time that she makes us wait for about 1 hour just to take the midterm examination.
0,"first, make sure to discuss all the topics that should be tackled. one out of three topics are the only progress every time she conduct classes. the rest, we have to do self-study which is very hard. make sure to tackle them all like provide the only essential information in every topic, we don't need irrelevant details. second, do not conduct quizzes at late night. we take our quizzes every saturday at 8pm. there this one time when we took it 11pm which i find very unhealthy for the students."
0,i don't know who told her but she is the only professor na bawal daw ang recording of classes. siya lang po which is very confusing. kaya medyo nahirapan din kami na matutunan yung lessons niya kasi walang recording na pwedeng balikan. she always argues that there is not enough time for our classes which is ironic kasi min she wastes almost 30 mins of our time saying things she already said minutes ago or in the previous meet.
0,"she should be strict in time because in our midterms exam, our scheduled time is 8 in the evening but she opened the assessment past 9 in the evening. also, she cannot maximize and manage her time well such as if there are 3 topics to be discussed, she only covers 1 topic of it and she puts the responsibility for us to learn the rest of the topic on our own."
0,pagtuturo po kasi isang beses lang po sya nagturo samin.
0,"it would be the best if he would teach than giving us school works without even lecturing. it was honestly a great time not having classes to a certain subject but not all the time. he should practice being more approachable towards his students, avoid being intimidating as it might cause conflict. less school works if he knows that he didn't lecture a single thing. make it look like he reads the works of his student."
0,teach more.
0,"hindi nagturo kahit isang beses sa amin, isang beses lang po kami nimeet tapos wala pang ginawa. laging ang chat sa gc namin na sasabihing wala daw class is kapag hindi naman namin schedule sa kanya. this final term instead na siya ang magturo pinaggawa lang kami ng ppt presentation and kami din pinagreport ng buong final term. laging ang daming reasons kung bakit hindi niya kami mamemeet. puro essays ang pinapagawa and ang process niya ng pagbibigay ng grades is ""up to us"" daw which is very unfair."
0,"skills in teaching, because he just meet as for only one day."
0,he should value the time and efforts of the students.
0,he must teach during the school hours
0,"he only met us once and gained nothing from it and in spite of his busy and hectic schedule he should make time for his students to meet us.
he just gives us activities that is good for a week and that leaves us to self study that program without (sometimes) giving a clear instruction.

1,good instructor
0,the activities and quizzes are too many. i know these activities could improve ourselves but the length of time given is too short.
0,the instrument used to measure students knowledge about the lesson is impractical such as quizzes and test. learners just doing memorization rather than understanding the life of rizal.
0,be a teacher.
0,"be considerate, don't give many hard quizzes, activities and examination. don't give long questions in examination if your time is not enough. because it reflects also to you as a teacher."

0,didn't do an excellent job of sparking my interest in a course. he was also unable to explain things in a clear and organized way because he was always absent from our class.

0,"he needs to be more approachable.
be more considerate.
inconsistent.
didn't even meet/taught us anything in midterms and finals, and yet we have exams to take on his subject."
0,time management and concern for the students
0,"these are the ff. reasons why he needs improvement:
1. he didn't attend to his class on the right schedule. 
2. 2 or 3 weeks before the christmas break until the last week of class, he didn't attend in our class. all he gave is one power point presentations for finals.
3. during one of his discussions, he identified number zero in positive side of the number line. i am confused because i know that the zero is neutral number. i ask him about it, he insisted that the zero is only in the positive side. i searched it on google just to make sure and i realized that he is really wrong. i am concerned that the other students will receive this kind of false information.
4. i wish that he give more considerations to his students.
5. one time we ask him why he didn't follow our class schedule, he told us he has part time jobs in other schools. for this reason, we always adjusted our time for that reason. i suggests that he needs to make room also in adjustments.
6. we've waited for almost one month in his midterm exam, we always initiate the chat and i hope he take initiative sometimes about the exam.
7. i hope he will be a responsible professor because his students are always waiting for his classes and announcements."
0,needs to improve in student communication
0,"sorry to say, but he is an ineffective instructor, lacks punctuality, and doesn't communicate with us students. we know he has reasons, but at least tell us why. it's hard for me to say, but i hope he improves himself as a responsible teacher."
0,accessible outside class hours and give application activity.
0,be more approachable especially when students are asking questions with regards to the lesson.

1,no more improvements for her. because she taught us well
1,kailangan lang po niya ipagpatuloy ang kanyang ginagawa dahik napakagaling niya pong guro.
0,"first, he needs to attend to our class every synchronous class, the last time we met is since last synchronous class of prelim. second, he needs to teach us what are the concepts presented in geometry because it is important to us as math major. third, he needs to communicate or do announcement so that we are inform if he will be doing online class if he wanted. fourth, he is doing examination that students never expected. lastly, when he is teaching he is very unmotivated and tired of teaching."
0,attending class. exchange of ideas. delivery of teaching

0,be always present in the synchronous classes so that the students will learn this courses also he need to have more motivation in teaching this subject. sometimes be active in answering the inquiries of students.
0,this instructor seldomly attend to his class. he lacks competence to properly guide his students in reporting. he gives very unclear instructions about his activities quizzes and exams. he provide very ineffective assessment which is ironic because his subject is about the assesment of learning. this isn't his first time teaching our section. and he performed exactly like this in our past subject.
1,keep in touch sometimes. but he's good
0,attending class and conducting teaching (not just relying on the reportings of his students).

0,"given our course, he doesn't meet us every week and maybe we only have 3 to 4 meetings for this whole semester."
0,be more focused as an instructor since fs needs the guidance of the instructor. ensure that the pre-service teachers are well guided since they are already deployed in their cooperating school and what they do there will mirror ccc as an institution.

0,"i've only had bad experiences with prof. he sets schedules at times when it's not his schedule (in my class, it's every monday, from 5:30 to 8:30 pm), and oftentimes, he forgets that he has a class schedule to his set times. when he does attend his classes, around 20% of the time is spent on stories he tells us about his experiences. the remaining time is reserved for doing lab work where we code. he rarely shows us what he does when coding and only gave us a youtube channel of another professor in school.

if i have to be honest, i didn't learn much from him despite the module being helpful. i hope he gets replaced by a better teacher. if that happens, i wish him the best of luck and also to teach more."

0,needs to further elaborate the lessons

0,"for me, wala naman po masama kung sasabihin kong hindi siya nagbibigay ng examples on how we will do the program. all we do is self-study. modular type of studying. bilang hindi naman lahat ng estudyante may pare parehas na accuracy sa pag intindi lalo sa module na type compare sa estudyanteng mas nagegets yung topic kapag itinuturo talaga ito. we know the ""nasa estudyante yan kung gusto matuto"" pero since ako hindi ako masyadong knowledgable sa programming i still studying my programming ability nanonood nalang ako dun sa channel ni maam regz na nakaupload sa youtube niya para atleast doon po may matutunan ako kahit paunti unti."

0,she need to be straight to the point of what she discuss.
0,"there are a couple of problems with prof. lectures. firstly, she presents her lecture by writing on the word document of the module itself, rather than using a whiteboard  secondly, her way of teaching is very serious and almost robotic. i have tried to follow the concepts, but in the end, i get bored of her lectures. third, she assumes that we already know what was discussed before, which is not entirely true.

i suggest that she teach with a whiteboard marker and a whiteboard to further explain the concept properly. it is a shame that she is hampered by the pandemic's limited resources because she seems very knowledgeable about the topic."

0,more example pa para mas maintindihan
0,"i hope he reduces his strictness, but all in all he is good at teaching."
0,the instructor must know a much more effective way of teaching for the students to understand truly the lessons he is trying to teach. for it feels like a waste of such talent that he cannot be able to deliver properly his lessons.
0,his teaching
0,explain the topic orderly
0,"there are many spaces for improvement, i hope they can understand that not all it students have the ability to learn accounting that fast, especially those who took ict as their strand during shs."
0,"one of the profs who use ""this is college na"" as an excuse to justify their b1tchyness. will say they're preparing you for the world, but when you get to the ""real world"", you realize it's not worth dealing with people like them bruh"
0,i think he still needs to improve his exam because he is sometimes not considerate because he has a rule in the exam that when 1 violation means you are zero in the exam. so my concern is that he will be considerate because it is not our fault that we lost the internet or someone called our phone number on our device. and sometimes it's scary to approach him so we can preach or or it may be our fault when we are the ones who complain.

0,"the instructor should improve their knowledge and use of internet tools and programs that can assist or provide ease in conducting her classes. attendance is done manually, and it takes up to much time. pauses too much in between sentences. should refrain from sending school works outside school hours, specially at midnight. sila nga di ma-reach/ma-contact pagpatak nang 5pm onwards and yet they expect us to still be available at that time."

0,increasing enthusiasm in class.
0,"based on what i observed, ma'am is utilizing the questioning technique in every session, however, my concern is, sometimes she overdoes it. i get the whole point of asking questions in the class, but to do it throughout the whole time of discussion is kind of unsettling to our end. the reason for this circumstance is that our focus is being diverted to answering her questions about what we know about the lesson instead of learning first what she is about to discuss."

0,i hope the discussion will be more often
0,"1. i wish he won't combine our online class with the other section since we are already packed when discussing.
2. i really wish he'd given us more examples not just activities when we aren't that knowledgeable enough with some of the accounting terms and computations.
3. i hope he reads the module first before discussing because it seems like he isn't that prepared when teaching but afar from that, he knows what he's saying so it's all good.
4. i wish he prepares sometimes or joke a little so his class would be enjoyable.
5. i wish he'd stop saying ""madali lang to"", ""napag aralan nyo na to nung shs"" and skips that part because not all students are smart enough to comprehend all those lessons before.
6. give the activities before exam so we won't be loaded with activities. there are days when i don't know how to manage my time anymore."
0,"in giving more than 5 activities, you should give enough time to accomplish it."
0,"consideration on deadlines especially for activities that he didn't taught us instead us learning it ourselves. it's almost impossible to make activities in less than 48 hours and learning all the processes ourselves. we're students, what did he expexted?"
0,"his character and attitude towards his students. also he could be a little more considerate in giving task to his students because sometimes, i mean, most of the time he gave so many task but the deadline is too short for us to answer and submit. also his way of teaching. sometimes he jumps topic to another topic because he thinks we already know well the lesson he is teaching where in fact we understand it poorly."

0,teaching
0,"the instructor gives so many activities that i think he is not able to handle to check one by one, so he gave the same scores to many, if not all of his students."
0,"he needs to improve his communication and concern of the student. he needs to be more understanding in giving the students a span of time to finish the activities he gave. also, he needs to understand that students have also other subjects to fullfil, so dont give the student too much activities with a short period of deadline. in addition, he needs to improve his communication in terms of explaining the lessons to the students and also to attend the class often"
0,"to lighten the question in quiz and exam and to give more time in answering it. for a 10 item question we only have 18 minutes to answer. there is a lot of computation to do and the problem is long, reading and understanding it will consume a lot of time. we can't skip the question. then if he give a lot of exercise he need to check it not just giving all of the students a score of 90. for the attendance whether you're always present or not we will receive 95 equivalent to 19%. we need to be graded fairly in exercise and attendance because the exam is hard."
0,the time given to the students to answer activities weren't enough considering the amount given.
0,"explain to students the lessons. do not say ""madali lang 'to"" then skip that topic. examination time are limited to 18 mins for 10 questions mix of long computation and terminologies. grade computation, students who attend class and do not attend class have the same grades on attendance sheet. loaded school works, lack of time to check. the midterm activities, we are all 90/100 on more or less 10 activities without giving us the solutions and correct answers."

1,i think nothing..
0,"i think it would be better if prof. would concise his lectures into brief segments in powerpoint presentation. often times, we could sometimes see that he is just reading off of the module, although he seems to be very knowledgeable of the topic at hand. given his age, he can be slow at times."
0,the way he teach.
0,use student feedback to shape learning with just in time learning strategies.
0,"for me, this is a good help because you can take it to your old age."
0,"as long as i easily understand, there's nothing to improve."

0,voice audio.
0,give more time to students try not to give so many consecutive activities because were also doing our activities on another subjects
1,nothing everything is perfect
1,anything are all good
1,"for me, is good when it comes to being ""masipag"" pero yung pagiging available niya po ay hindi na naaayon. yes to teacher na masipag at always present but hindi po tama na palagi ka ngang present pero yung natututunan namin ay wala, wala dahil napipilitan nalang kaming gumawa dahil kailangang ipasa. for example he gave us activities every week, hindi pa niya natuturo yung lesson may nakalagay na a na activity, though yes mababalikan namin yung lesson pero kailangan parin namin ng maayos na pagtuturo. overall okay naman, but needs improvement siguro po 'wag lang masyadong may pagawa palagi."
0,"i think the improvement should be regarding the deadline because sometimes it overlaps the weekends and sometimes, holiday."
0,good teaching
1,"i have no problem with the instructor, the only problem is we need a f2f classes."

1,ayos naman si sir mag turo at super bait niyanf prof

0,their accessibility is the areas that need to improve.
0,"she always rely on her coordinator, she always schedule meeting late and clashes with other classes dedicated schedule. she barely interact with the student because she said she is always busy."

1,nothing. maybe she can still make her teaching strategies more efficient but it is actually satisfactory already.
0,we meet the professor seldom and i don't know why. but she provides activities for us to answer during her class hours.
0,"maybe also of her busy schedule, we sometimes have a few meetings, but those meetings are satisfied us, but i hope we can meet a lot before, because i really learn a lot from her, and i still want to learn from her."
0,always use the synchronous class to the fullest because i love the way she teaching us but it sad to say that we barely have an online class with our instructor
0,more turo po since ang course ay surveying literature.
0,"we are just having class session rarely. she just gave us activities and the deadline of it. for me learning our own doing the activities isn't enough, it is different if it's coming from the teacher itself because we are not knowledgeable enough about the subject."
0,the use of each session for lectures and enough time for discussing each lesson.
0,maybe next time she can discuss the confusing part of the literary piece that she has given.
0,"it would be much advisable if the modules were presented better, although the contents are good and filling."
0,"i wish he can lessen the activities, and can we have a feedback to our work so we can improve it"

0,"the professor uploaded midterm modules on finals term, and was unavailable/absent for the whole midterm. it would also take weeks (as per my experience) for her to reply to student concerns via email (the only platform she allows, basically ignores private messages on fb, but disseminates ouncements in fb thru her class representatives which is sometimes not seen by other students [ouncements should be made/uploaded in lms]. the first 3 lectures from midterm are pre-recorded which makes it even harder to ask questions/raising concerns as there will be no live q&a afterwards. we only had 1 live class in our section for this semester (which was for prelim)."

1,i believe that our professor always do his best when it comes to teaching so keep it up.
0,"too strict. it's alright to be strict but the strictness shown is just too much. the instructor seems to not give much consideration to other students, for example to those students who can't afford and have broken mics will be deemed as absent. and for other activities , not all students are artistic especially since not all members in a group moves and barely 3-4 are doing something about it. it would be good if the instructor assign the groupings himself, because those who already knows each other tends to come together leaving behind other students. but, the instructor is very knowledgeable indeed in the subject and i hope to learn more from him."

0,"i think, she need to improve her way of teaching."
0,perhaps she should let her students speak themselves. she should listen to their reasoning to maintain understanding.
0,the instructor should make the students feel more safe by not being ill-tempered.
0,"this is my opinion and observations, she must be friendly, approachable and not too judgmental when students make mistakes. she's already professional in her own belief but in my own eyes, she is not. she must avoid embarrassing students during class when she's anger. she must be accommodating when students are intended to speak up and not be judging when the answer are incorrect."

0,avoid being angry. just chill and relax.
0,"her attitude. i am not into respecting age but the people's characters themselves. i remember when we were forced hustle to be able to submit the stressing video presentation just for her to turned off her camera, unmuted her microphone and gossip with another person in her house. after the presentations, she even managed to give us the word, ""bravo!"" as if she really watching our fruit of hardwork. she doesn't. we heard everything! i also conclude that she was a type of student before who was spoon-fed as she doesn't know the real struggle of juggling work, life and academic commitment. we are all trying. we are all surviving. tell her to humble down herself. i have never experienced to be humiliated by this person, but my classmates who are trying their best just to come up with the situation. please, retire, ms. . you are not helping."
0,"i think the instructor should invest and iinovate in the method of teaching. instead of just reading from the module, try something more engaging. it is fun to learn if students are engaged and have the freedom to express themselves without the fear of being reprimanded if something was done wrong. i also suggest to have more consideration in quizzes and exams. sometimes lms does not accept the answer because the correct answer was mispelled and the score remained unchecked."
0,"knowledge about the internet connection, signals, and situation of the students. speaking tone and accepting of positive criticism."
0,"most of the time, the students just passively receive information regarding the topics. i think the instructor should consider giving more engaging activities to avoid dull moments in class."
0,be more considerate to students. lalo na ol class not everyone has stable internet connection. don't shame students who can't participate well just because mahina ang internet connection nila.
0,"she is very strict even when the students are doing nothing. at one point she got mad at me because she thought someone was answering for me over the google meeting, but that's just my voice that kind of sounded like a man's. i was quite humiliated about that which made me very hesitant to come into her class."
0,"student mental health, emotional support, and approach students more nicely. every small thing she makes it complicated. during the online class, we, students are aware of policies, however, we cannot avoid unexpected noises, and if we cannot stop the noise she will get mad and says anything. she is just reading the lesson, not explaining it. her approach to her students is poor, she humiliated me in front of my classmates. she promises to talk after the class, but she shouts at me, insensitive. she is a teacher for a longer year, she must aware of these things."

0,"the professor is inconsiderate. there are many instances that he had gave us a quiz but turned out some of our answers, which we are very sure of, appears to be incorrect. our assumption is, he had mistakenly input wrong or incomplete answers that is why lms did not considered ours to be correct. even though we reach out to him regarding this matter, he seems not to care and did not do anything to resolve the issues."

0,the presentation
1,he has nothing to improve. such a good professor.
1,none because he has consideration every students and respect our time.
0,may times na medyo mabilis yung way of teaching niya kaya minsan may mga students na di maka engage sa topic. ending they will not get interested to dig and read. sometimes yung strictness niya turn to inconsiderate to someone though we understand there's a rules to follow but there are times na dapat he gives consideration sa mga walang wifi at data ang ginagamit if they not pass the google forms on time there will be deduction or worst case if di nasend di na tatanggapin. i hope di na ganto next time.
0,way of teaching
0,sana medyo lively and less serious yung class

0,mode of teaching.
0,medyo dalian naman po ang quiz and exam
0,"even though his knowledge is excellent, it's sad to say but he lacks the heart. i felt like he did not try to connect with us, he's only focused on performing his task."
0,communicating and interacting more to his student.
0,i hope he can make the explanation much easier to understand.
0,"the instructor needs to be more engaging to its students, have care to the person behind the camera or those circular pieces you meet on virtual meetings. be some kind of considerate to the online set up, we are human not robots."
0,"siguro po yung way ng pagtuturo niya po, kasi kahit anong pakikinig namin every morning wala kami gaano naaabsorb sa tinuturo niya at medyo nakakaantok po yung boses niya. at isa pa po ay yung pag may seatwork or quiz malate lang saglit may deduction na agad. and dapat sa lms nagpapaquiz po."
0,try to discuss the lessons profoundly.
0,the delivery of topics is not sufficient for the students. some of the assessments were mostly cannot be seen on the modules. he's not considerate sometimes when there are internet problems though there is a solid evidence.
0,give more examples and specific situations

0,"improvement of the audio quality, maybe because of the mic he's been using or it is closer on his mouth that even unnecessary noise(like breathing) is a little disturbing"
0,sometimes there's a schedule conflict.
0,"the professor only read the module, there are no examples, the given accessible time in an activity is not enough for us to answer all the questions. there is no computation but we have to read a paragraph before we answer each item. there is a time that he gave a seat work that consists of so many items and some of the items have a long question. there are a lot of time that most of us are unable to finish until the end of the given seat work because of the not enough time to answer."
0,"the time to answer all of the questions on the gform and we always tend to be nervous because of it lead to guessing the answers and submitting but not yet finished. then, i suggest to at least make it longer. thank you!"
0,explain further the topics not only by reading the hand outs.
0,"always put in mind that not all students are capable to reach the said time of quizzes with a limited time given. as a student, we cared for each other even though we didn't know each other, especially the students who are currently at work. also don't always changed decisions when it comes to everything, have a consistency in your words and decisions."
0,"i wish they were more considerate of the situations of the other students. it might sound unfair but i feel students have adapted more onto them rather than them adapting to the students. despite it all, thank you, ma'am for your hard-work."
0,"time management and avoid having unrealistic expectations, especially now that we are in the midst of a pandemic."
0,improve her communication with the students and how she can make them to participate in class.
0,the areas of improvement for the instructor was the engagement of students in discussion.
1,"honestly speaking, prof. is a very good instructor, she already knows what to do and what to discuss during class. that`s why i believe she is the best instructor and there`s no room for improvement because she always does her best for us to learn to improve our knowledge and skills."
0,i cant think of any areas that needs to improve
0,i think using of increase text size is better instead of using screen zoom feature.
1,wala. dahil mahusay na siya as in.
1,nothing in particular.
0,"once an instructor or coach has identified a specific area for improvement, they should define a specific individual goal for the area, identify the related organizational goals, and specify the measure of success. each goal should be accompanied by a list of specific actions, which should be accompanied by a list of resources required."

1,nothing to improve
1,wala na po kase magaling magturo
0,"beyond the first term (midterm and final term), there have been significantly less individual activities in relation to the subject at hand. this would make it look like the professor trusts that the students are capable of learning the lesson without further evaluations. if there are any instances where there are students that didn't quite understand the subject enough, then it may be too late when the professor ultimately finds out when there are little to no opportunities that remain."
0,sa way nang pagsasalita medyo iloud pa
0,"although this may be attributed to preparing for a potential shift to face-to-face classes, the midterm and final term felt lacking in terms of activity. there are some, for sure, but the prelim term included a graded recitation that was promised throughout the whole semester. in other words, such graded recitations and activities were expected, but slowed to a halt as the final term precedes."

0,on her way of teaching
0,siguro po ang need i-improve is ano mas i-guide po yung students kase hindi naman po lahat ng students is alam kung tama or mali na yung ginagawa lalo na pagdating sa requirements na pinapagawa
1,"i would not really give much recommendations for improvement, but if there would be a system like this, the personnel in charge of said system must make sure that it can be utilized within the semester rather than become a fleeting thought. this is an area of improvement that may not necessarily be possible, so the removal of said system is preferred, if the circumstances make it inevitably unusable. that may not necessarily sound like a problem, but that's another cluster of words that students may remember instead of actual lesson material."
0,"i hope she handle the class well, in whole sem we just meet her one time only."
1,"i can't really say anything here, not because of oppressive fear or excessive respect, but because i simply cannot think of any way to improve the delivery of lessons and his overall approachability."

0,i think she is on time when giving quizzes and activities
0,i think to have more engage to the students
0,magbigay ng overview sa topic/s bago mag-pareport
0,"the group reporting went well, and went better and better each week as time passed, but by the start of the midterms, she took it upon herself to do the explanations of the lessons and this became less interpretative in the same level and more about what she is able to convey to the students, as the old traditional way of teaching. there was nothing wrong with that idea, but having students learn of the lesson beforehand, make a presentation, and convey what they took from that lesson towards the rest of the class was a good use of the time, but the rest of the semester lacked the same vibrant tone that the prelims held.

in other words, try to keep it crafty, and try to find ways where the students can learn the subject easier, rather than having them interpret the idea by themselves, which can be hard if they don't have a clue where to start piecing together the information within a topic."
0,giving some real life examples regarding the topic may be
0,her communication with students and be more approachable
0,sana lang he was able to meet us ng medyo madalas. i felt like mas marami pa sana kaming matututunan if mas maraming beses namin siya na meet.
0,"i hope you could give some sample activities that doesn't have to apply scores, maybe a plus only to the highest student or something. students need to practice themselves and giving them the resources and the ability to explain them the activities will be good. i don't know with others sir, but expect us that before we go to class we already read something and we may also bring some questions in mind. we could practice and discuss outputs or ask questions that is not clear to us while on class, so that the pressure goes not on the quiz and score but upon practicing what we read. this is applied by our professor before, and we loved how she taught us how to not value scores but learning."
0,do not give consideration to students not passing outputs and taking quiz and exam on time because it is unfair to other students. these lazy students apparently got even the highest scores and grade there should be a deduction to their scores. please bring back the original grading system in f2f classes cause it will help many students now that it is hard to live in pandemic
0,"to manage time well, because sometimes he cancel class unexpectedly.

0,"based on what we have observed, i guess he should stop translating and reading the ppt. expound more about the subject/topic. check the issues needed to support or to reject some ideas presented. not all in the module can be correct to others. 
let the student expressed their selves in class, have an interactive activity. 

make sure, to be equal in giving students task, make sure that the quiz is though to the students very well. 
quizzes and especially exam should be at least very easy as it was discussed but the problem is, it was never been expound in the class, that makes the learners confused during the examination. 

he should frequently asked students about their affective learning, or at least talked to them through announcement or through class how they are. 

he looks like he is not interested to his subject that let the subject boring though it can be fun to discussed with.

0,"he showed up only 3 times for the whole semester. the first one was the meet and greet. the second, was a short discussion. the third was to give our final requirement."
0,he taught only 3 times throughout the sem.
0,"honestly, he is really kind. however, he attended 2-3 online sessions only the whole semester. he is always busy attending other matters. i think even though he has many things to do, it is his responsibility to attend class. excuses may be valid but the learning outcomes of the students are more valid."
0,"prof attended our synchronous class only twice the whole sem. despite of that, he's constantly giving us loads of activities!"
0,"there are lot of things needed to improve, i learned nothing from him to be honest. he met our section once in the entire prelim and the meeting goes like introducing ourselves and the expectations to the subject. the second is he just read the ppt he prepared and that's it, the only word that i learned from that was ""bonzai"". then the third and the last he appeared on meeting is on finals, 1hr discussion about 21st and that's it. he always in a meeting/brigada/3-day training/ has migraine etc. but the activities never missed, it's too unfair for us because the activities are needed to be discussed first. i thought the subject would be fun, but it wasn't."
0,he always disappeared in everyday meet. he always not around when we have concerns. he always busy doing his stuffed. he just provide us a bulk of activities that he did not taught us. he always reschedule the meet because of his multiple reasons.

0,being there/present is a must.
0,to allot enough time to discuss the lesson and meet the students often as following the given schedule
0,he needs to be consistent in attending the class. he only met us twice and just gave us activities the whole semester.
0,"he only attended in our class thrice (3 times) in the whole semester, one of them is during the 1st week of lms class wherein it is supposed to be asynchronous. he also said that our lessons are ""like a modular mode"" thus it is self explanatory. he rarely interacts with us."
0,health
0,"hopefully, can attend synchronous class more often."
0,"i suggest that allot time to discuss the lesson. we only met three times in the whole semester. the first session which was the getting to know class, the second was before the prelim examination, and the last one was on the last synchronous class before the final examination. follow the schedule given. also, as the memorandum posted by the officials, the final requirement in the subject for me, is not that important and will not give any development on us in the subject matter."
0,"- we only met thrice this semester.
- manage his time and responsibilities well as jhs teacher and colleger instructor"

0,we only had few only classes on his subject and he only left us with activities without him having a chance to taught the lessons.

0,be considerate especially if the reason is valid
0,"- more energy in discussions
"
1,there’s nothing to improve.

0,lessen lots of activities that i think is unnecessary
1,no recommendations needed.
0,"- competence, sana siya gumawa ng sarili niyang exam kasi mas allign kung anong nangyari sa klase namin.
- weird pattern, nauuna yung mga activities bago kami magklase. nadedefeat yung purpose ng synchronous class."
0,"maybe, he should stay upon doing different from other teachers instead of doing the same thing they do. he is very unique yes but he choose to copy other's requirement, that make the activity very hard but that's quite fine."
0,"he prepared lots of activities, and some students can't cope up with it."
1,he is always listening to our concerns.
0,maybe their skills of teaching

1,there is no need for improvement.

0,be present always in her class schedule.
0,giving a clear instruction to the activities that she uploaded in our lms.
0,looking forward for her to briefly explain the details on how to make a better content of research
0,"since she is teaching research, i think she can be more specific and detail in explaining such part or concept because moat of us are not yet very familiar in research makiling especially in qualitative and mixed research."
0,her voice is not that clear and loud
0,discussion of the subject needs to increase
0,"di tumatanggap ng sagot ng students hanggang sa napapahiya sana marunong siya makaappreciate at wag niya sana ipilit ang gusto niyang sagot. at kung gusto niya talaga ng sagot, sana sabihin niya agad hindi yung magtatawag ng students hanggang maubos na ang oras"
0,"sometimes he does not follow the given schedule. for example, in a week we have 2 synchronous classes. aside from that during the christmas break, there's a memorandum that there should be no activity given to us during that time, but he still gave us."

1,best.
0,clear instructions and activities is needed to improve.
0,"should be more lenient with in class activities/groupings. groupings/discussion is handicapped in distant learning, and he insists real time collaboration despite the handicap."
0,"- learn to accept answer especially, if it is opinion
- do not cut his students while answering/giving opinion, give us time until we fully answered/expressed ourselves
- dont be too bookish. dont demand for word for word answers"
0,"hopefully, will let students answer based on their opinion without getting intimidated."
0,"he’s too busy, make a more interactive discussion."
0,he should have at least discussed rather than making us all reporters throughout the sem.
0,"be interactive in class, be considerate and most importantly be more relative in the class lesson."
0,he is just good in teavhing
0,as an instructor being present is a must.
0,following the schedule of our classes and exams.
0,"he should've discuss and not make his students a reporter the whole sem.
"
0,"for the whole semester, we are the one who is reporting the lessons. it's good but i think we still need his guidance."
0,simula prelim hanggang finals kami ang nagreport sa klase. hindi manlang nagkaroon ng time to have a lesson on class.
0,prof was often absent. gives an assessment without even teaching the material.
0,"looking forward to teach the lessons, not pure reporting"
0,he understood too much
0,"hopefully, can update the students about things beforehand and can discuss the lesson even for a short while."
0,mas okay sana kung sya ang magrereport kasi ang subject ay assessment of learning na dapat from prof ang knowledge at hindi galing saming mga baguhan o wala pa talagang alam
0,"sana magturo sya, because all throughout the semester kami ang nagreport ng lesson na sya dapat ang nagturo."
0,absenteeism
0,there are no meetings that he discussed a topic. also there are no constructional feedbacks on every reporter.
0,more engagement with the class
0,he is lazy and made us report the whole course in the whole semester. he do not announce if we will have a class or not unless one of us contact him.
0,"check the course design so that they know which lesson is included in the prelim, midterms and finals. give activities or some quiz to students so that they could have a grade, and not just full reporting because we actually learned a little trough that. he rarely clarifies the reports and still cannot decide whether we have an exam or just a final output even though it's already exam week, which also indicates that the end of this semester is near."
0,i hope the proffesor meet us since he never meet us during our finals. he only meet us once or twice during our midterms. i hope he didn't misunderstood the letter addressed to him. the only content of the letter is to lessen the activities he gave since he gave 5-8 activities.
0,mahirap po intindihin kapag ang ginagamit na learning material during discussion ay yung module po na in word format. sana po gumamit ng ibang form ng pagtuturo lalo na mahirap po yung subject.
0,maging considerate sana sya sa mga students. hindi naman kasi pare pareho ng pinagdadaanan
0,"the professor's way of teaching, for me, is ineffective. he only read the module, we meet virtually every other friday in prelims and midterms, and he only teach us for an hour. but during finals, we never met him, he only uploaded 2 modules, without any recorded video lectures, that makes it hard for us to understand the topic."
0,sana naman po next time wag niya lang binabasa yung modules na inauupload niya. na mmeet lang namin siya once in a week tapos magbabasa lang siya ng modules sa time niya samin. he should also be considerate and bawasan yung mga activities niya. we know na its a major subject pero di lang naman yang subject na yan ang meron kami. i feel like my experience and learnings here in this subject could've been better if mas nagawa niya i explain yung mga topics in a better way. hindi yung literal na binabasa lang wala man lang deeper explanations and hindi man lang siya nag pprovide ng other concepts for us to grasp the topics
0,"i wish he should provide a synchronous class every week or even a recorded video posted online as this course for me is the same as what we do in the modular class. he always have a limited time in doing synchronous classes and i think the students was not effectively learned in this course. in prelims, the activities are too loaded for us to answer it and during the finals, we didn't get even one synchronous class from him."
0,para po sakin siguro po yung naexperience namin nung prelim exam week. nagsabay sabay po kasi yung 7 exercises namin kay sir at yung dalawang activities at dalawang parts ng exam. consedering din po na may async po nun during exam week
0,"don't give activities, quizzes and everything without actually having ""proper"" discussion. this finals nga, no discussion talaga. so paano kami sa exam? :)"
0,sometimes there's a schedule conflict.
0,i hope he can give more understandable illustration of the problem.
0,his way of teaching. parang binabasa niya lang yung ppt then konting paliwanagan. maraming magbigay ng activity nung una.

0,not much. excellent instructor.
0,consistent class check in?
0,"sana po mas malinaw pa mag explain, hindi basta binabasa lang yung module. we already read that, we need thorough explanation and real situations to apply such topics. the subject is very interesting sana kaso super nakakadisappoint ang way ng pagtuturo."
0,sometimes unprofessional
0,"attitude.
character.
social skills."
0,he should learn how to listen to his students. don’t always say that you will not teach/give importance to a certain topic since we already took it in our previous courses since we also need to refresh our minds.
0,need to explain and show how the computation works. iba ang computation sa lesson na binigay sa mga quizzes.
0,"the way he communicates with the students. minsan po pilosopo sya sumagot sa mga tanong namin, pero naiintindihan naman po namin siguro pagod lang sya sa work."
0,be considerate sometimes when it comes to quizzes and exam especially if its beyond the control of the students (internet connectivity) .
0,consideration to students
0,"she is kind of boring because of the presentation-explanation kind of way of her teaching. she should try to practice a more participative class, that's the only thing to improve for her to catch the students' attention."
0,haha mam kulang ka po sa interaction with students sorry po.....
0,"when doing activities and projects, she should expand on her explanations. she should also take a break from speaking because if she keeps going, i won't be able to catch up all."
0,siguro po yung ang bilis nya pong mag turo like yung final po namen naisama na sa midterm pero advantage din naman po yun kasi ngayon di na po sya sumabay sa iba na ang dame pong ipapasa

0,"interact more with the students, she usually does all the explanation during her class."
0,"she's fast at teaching which is a good thing for me, i don't know about the other students though."
0,medyo taasan po pag bibigay ng grades kasi kahit napasok at nag sasagot ng every quiz e nalagpak parin ng 5. imbis na maasikaso ng student yung mga major subs e mas nahahatak sila ng minor sub na about sa nakalipas na pangyayari pa at di na maibabalik
0,she needs to relieve her internal pressure on teaching 'cause when our class starts it really starts right away without any greetings or introduction.
0,gadgets or internet connection. the share screen is sometimes at like 1-30fps in a span of a minute
0,"she's some type of a moderate teacher, i do think that she could've done better in utilizing her presentation to a more diverse and intricate production of teaching."
0,i feel like her subject is major because her quizzes is more than what other major subjects give also the projects especially the exam.
0,habaan ang pasensya sa pasaway na students huwag po mainis ka agad kapag wala pong nasagot agad sa itinatanong niyo. magaling ka po mag paliwanag at maayos magturo lalo na maganda makipag usap sa aming klase.
0,matampuhin at toyoin
0,medyo madame po syang pinapagawa like ngayon po sabi nya animation po kameng gagawin kasi di daw po namen natapos yung lesson bukod pa po yung quiz and final exam po. hanggang nagayon po wala paden naman po syang sinisend sa lms about doon pero sana po wag naman agad agad kailangan ipasa na kasi final exam po next week.
0,"she should teach the lesson clearly not just ""class watch these documentaries about rizal"" and proceed like everyone understood the previous lesson clearly. being nice and kind isn't always a good thing to do. i am expecting much more interaction during our classes."
0,yung exam malayo yung mga tanong dun sa mga binibigay na lessons

0,"his vio lessons and the tailed execution of the course should be more concise, and more realistic to see. he should be consirate to the stunts and give cent gras because the actual of p.e vios are hard in itself."
0,grabe po sya mag pa activity yung arnis po pero keri lang yung di lang po keri yung isang beses po nag pa arnis po sya tapos yung klase nya po ay 6:30 pm to 7 pm kailangan na daw po namen ipasa hanggang 10 pm biruin nyo po arnis po yun yong iba po walang pwesto sa bahay yung iba naman po madilim na sa labas ng bahay pero syempre kahit ganon pan nag pasa pan po kame syempre sayang po ang gra doon mahirap pa naman po mag pa open ulit ng pasahan sa lms

0,"provide more guidance outside school hours, please be easier to contact when needed"
0,teaching skills
0,i hope is that the professor respond the message that sent by the student because some of them doesn't respond
0,he should upload all of the activities that should be done in our lms not just randomly announce it on his class right away 'cause not all of us are available during his class hours.
0,"icheck ang students kong nakakasunod lahat, dahil minsan ang bilis magturo"
1,good position in school
0,turaan pa kami ng maayos
0,he needs to elaborate the lesson more .
0,siguro po sa cisco application lang yung problema kailangan po kasi may acc tapos may bayad sya kaya hindi po ako maka pag save ng file na apk e puro apk ang need na ipasa.
0,teach slowly to easyly understand the students
0,"slowly teaching so that we can be more clear and understand because networking is extremely difficult, but i must stand because i have entered it."
1,"for me, there is no improvement needed for him."
0,"bagalan ang pag sasalita. at i acknowledge ang mga studyanteng walang computer desktop or laptop kasi in my experience di nya pinapansin yung mga naka cellphone lang and nag memessage kami sa mismong chat ng gmeet pero dedma lang sya sa mga tanong na ""sir pano po pag walang pc or laptop?"""
0,"the professor should be more detailed, concise, and relaxed in terms of his way of teaching especially when it comes to step-by-step learning of each little part. i do feel like he should tone down and maybe kind of thought that his students are not in his level way of thinking in terms of expertise in the course."
0,communicating
0,i think she needs to improve her time management but she always make other way to make things up
1,there are none i guess because being ill in this time is something we didn't want to happen and she got ill that's why she couldn't teach which is something to consider.
1,get well maam
0,"she could've maximized her synchronous class and taught us more frequent, concise, and detailed especially step-by-step learning in web development. most of us are not knowledgeable enough to work on our own but her lack of time compromises all our lessons."
0,di na sya nag turo mula mid december hanggang ngayon
0,should teach more rather than making us watch her learning materials. it feels like a waste of her talent.
0,more interaction with students
0,maybe ahmm not putting a background music on the recorded lecture
0,"i hope she can teach more because sometimes i didn't understand anything in our lesson because i was just watching, and it's hard to understand because the videos are sometimes blurry."
0,puro recorded video di na naexplain mabuti yung lesson
0,present us in class hours
0,"mahina ang boses halos hindi na marinig minsan, kapag nagbigay ng upload video ang labo ng quality plus andaming background noise at mahina din ang boses kaya ang kalalabasan e hindi namin maintindihan, and hindi na rin sya nagtuturo (pero naiintindihan naman namin na nagkasakit sya)"
0,kind
0,she needs to explain the lesson to her students clearly and give examples about the topics.
0,self study po kame nitong final kasi may sakit daw po si ma'am okay lang po yun pero yung exam po sa final hahaha lesson 1-9 wala lang po gusto ko lang sabihin pero syempre okay lang din po normal naman po yun syempre final hahaha
0,explaining briefly even with the small details because it is important to fully understand every single keyword in this course.
0,"learn how to dissect lessons technically and thoroughly by not just reading the presentation 
"
1,nothing to say
0,he should ask some questions about the lessons more frequently so he can promote interactions between students and the professor though it's quite annoying when he asked his students and he didn't get any response from them.
0,he needs to explain the lesson precisely for us to understand it better and interact in the discussion.

0,need to be present in our class hours
0,only a personal preference. it's better to teach more theory than practicality use in real life for this subject.
0,teach slowly
0,sana po medyo ma palawak pa or dahan dahan po sa pag tuturo at pag dadagdag ng mga information kasi ang hirap po nyang intindihin specially po sa mga walang laptop or pc na magagamit po. ito po yung subject na nahirapan po ako
0,"i learned not only his subject, but also his values, and he was kind even when no one answered in our class because we couldn't pick up quickly, which i was. even if i chat with him late at night, he will respond."
0,"obviously, his mindset and way of thinking that the students' minds are in the same position as him. he should tone down more of his expectations and assumptions for the class because as result, the students are mainly punished for his high standards. also, he doesn't give justice in giving us grades, he's not appreciative and he's too opinionated."
0,lessen being a terror tc but in the end you'll find the comedian side of sir mac!!!
0,good position in school for him as an instructor
0,lagi lang nag papa move ng schedule. nahihirapan mga working students kasi di nya minsan sinusunod ang schedule and nag hihingi ng move ng schedule sa mga students and kapag di napag bigyan sa favor. magagalit at papahirapan kami sa next meeting na parang kasalanan pa namin na gusto nya mag pa move ng meeting schedule
0,it's alright to tell his students the negative things that they needed to remove or change upon themselves but don't humiliate those individuals personally in the of the online class if there's something he didn't like address it as nicely as possible because most of us are struggling to cope with our mental health and there he is bluntly or frankly humiliating us in front of everyone in the google class.
0,"nothing much, i just prefer an examination instead of projects at this pandemic times."
0,"extend your teaching and don't be harsh with the students, especially during reporting time, because it makes us feel bad, especially when we speak poorly and embarrass ourselves."

0,listening to students concerns.
0,"i love madam au, but she should utilize her asynchronous class to make us watch her learning materials before her synchronous session with us."
0,more examples
0,mahirap lang dahil lagging recitation kada meeting and iba kasi samin mas natututo pag nakikignig nalang. iba kasi mas na pressure kung makakasagot ba o hindi e imbis na makinig nalang ng mapayapa sa lesson e mas kinakabahan mga ibang students
0,medjo marami magbigay ng upload video nauubusan na po kami minsan ng time gumawa sa ibang subject (minsan lang naman)
0,bilang isang abm student po noong g11 ang g12 gusto ko lang pong ibigay nya po yung tamang sagot sa mga activity po like yung journal and balancing para alam ko po bakit ganon yung score ko hahaha yung feeling na alam mo naman po yung sagot pero mababa yung score para naden po maintindihan ko kong ano yung pag kakamali ko para sa susunod po maitama na.

0,"please give more time on explaining the lesson, give more complex examples"
0,kaso sa una ang hirap makinig sakanya dahil sa messenger kami nag klase and ang hirap dahil kada may papasok na student e naka bukas ang mic so every may papasok napapatigil sya ng pag sasalita then sasabihin nya na i off ang mic. lumipat naman kami sa gmeet kaso di na sya nag turo after 2 meeting sa gmeet

0,"i suggest he should try to be more knowledgeable in terms of technologies, from the way he accesses the school's learning management system and even in the software that he uses for the class. aside from his multiple times of absences, unfortunately, the course outlines, lessons, quizzes, and exams are being done unpreparedly."
